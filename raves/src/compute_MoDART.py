    """
    Perform modal decomposition of acoustic radiance transfer for all frequency bands.

    This function reads path delays and etendues, assembles the state
    transition matrix per frequency band from the ART kernel and integer
    delays, searches for real positive poles above the given threshold,
    and writes mode eigen-pairs to CSV files. Optionally, it generates
    scatter plots of T60 values per band.

    Parameters
    ----------
    folder_path : str
        Path to the environment folder. Must contain:
        - path_delays.csv
        - path_etendues.csv
        - ART_kernel_band_1.mtx, ART_kernel_band_2.mtx, ...
    T60_threshold : float, default: 1e-1
        Minimum T60 (seconds) used to derive the eigenvalue threshold for
        pole search.
    max_slopes_per_band : int, default: 10
        Maximum number of modes reported per band in MoD-ART.csv.
    echogram_sample_rate : float, default: 5e3
        Sample rate in Hz used to quantize propagation delays.
    skip_T60_plots : bool, default: False
        If True, do not generate T60 scatter plots.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        Results are written to:
        - MoD-ART.csv
        - MoD-ART extra.csv
        - Optional PNG plots of T60 values (linear and log scale).

    Notes
    -----
    - Integer propagation delays are computed as floor(echogram_sample_rate * delay).
      If the minimum integer delay is below 3, the state transition matrix cannot be
      constructed; values below 10 trigger a warning.
    - Kernels are processed in order: ART_kernel_band_1.mtx, ART_kernel_band_2.mtx, ...
      Modes are appended to the CSVs one frequency band at a time.
    - Modes in each band are sorted by decreasing T60. Eigenvectors are scaled as
      discussed in `ART_theory.md`.
